This project was done during my technical course in Industrial Automation. In it, the user can choose between sorting algorithms: permutation, selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, or binary insertion sort; and search algorithms: linear or binary search. Additionally, the project involved creating, reading, or editing files.
